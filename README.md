**Interactive web plotting for Python using Bokeh**

## What is this book about?
Adding a layer of interactivity to your plots and converting these plots into applications hold immense value in the field of data science. The standard approach to adding interactivity would be to use paid software such as Tableau, but the Bokeh package in Python offers users a way to create both interactive and visually aesthetic plots for free. This book gets you up to speed with Bokeh - a popular Python library for interactive data visualization.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Installing Bokeh and understanding its key concepts
* Creating plots using glyphs, the fundamental building blocks of Bokeh
* Creating plots using different data structures like NumPy and Pandas
* Using layouts and widgets to visually enhance your plots and add a layer of interactivity
* Building and hosting applications on the Bokeh server

The code will look like the following:
```
#Output the plot

output_file('second_plot.html')

show(plot2)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is well suited for data scientists and data analysts who want to perform interactive data visualization on their web browsers using Bokeh. Some exposure to Python programming will be helpful, but prior experience with Bokeh is not required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-8).
